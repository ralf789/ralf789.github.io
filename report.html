<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>

<p>The website that I have created is for Otaku (fans of  manga) that want to learn about a manga called AJIN. It presents 4 important characters of the manga and gives basic information and statistics about them. To create this website I've used HTML(mostly for the text), CSS(For the design, like the title in the home page and the box of information in the characters pages) and JavaScript(for moving particles in the background). In the following lines I will tell you what inspired me to do this, how to use it and what it's made of. </p>

<p><b><u>Inspiration</u></b></p>

<p>Since I was a little, One of my biggest hobby was to read manga and draw their characters. That's why I've decided to do a website about <b>AJIN</b> which is one of my best manga. Instead of being just a regular cartoon that someone will watch for fun, <b>AJIN</b> has an amazing storylines based on reality with a little seasoning of fantasy. Overall, It in my top 5 manga including, <b>Naruto</b>, <b>Dragon Ball</b>, <b>Attack on Titan</b> and <b>City Hunter</b>. </p>
 
<p><b><u>Accessibility</u></b></p>

<p>A good website must be accessible to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. This is why I've tried to include "equivalent alternative text (alt text)" or "title" in the markup/code for every images. The website also have less text and more images to facilites the task to people that do not speak the languge or are not used to go a lot on the web(Older people).</p>

 
<p><b><u>Usability</u></b></p>
<p>I tried to make the website very easy to navigate for every one who wants to use it. By using the characters as a navigation bar, so that the user can just click on a particular character and have all the information about him without having scan the entire website. You can also see his transformation just by hovering over him, unless of course if he's <a href="Charcter_2.html" style="text-decoration: none">human. And also by blurring out the others when one is about to be selected.</a> </p>
    

<p><b><u>Strength and weaknesses</u></b></p>


<p>I think I worked well on the implementation of the particles background. At first, it seems extremely complicated from adding the particles to make it track and avoid the position of the mouse. But fortunately for me, with a lot of research online I've been able to learn how implement the code in my website to make it looks better.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately it ends up being one of my biggest mistakes, because I would've taken that time to develop a better website with more options, pages and interactions. The lesson that I've learned and was supposed to know is to not waste too much time on things that you don't understand.
